## Journey
My first experience to programming was in 2018, when I was in middle school. I used JS and html to write simple websites and Scratch to write programs for **_Minecraft education edition_**. In the same year, I started tinkering with bios options inside my computer, and nearly bricked it on several occasions when messing with my RAMs voltage. 

This initial exposure to technology and the underlying hardware is what led to my decision my freshman year of high school to take *Intro to Computer Programming.* A class in C++ that started at loops, and ended at classes. With us making an RPG throughout the entirety of the year. (mine ended up around 3000 loc and was pretty bad :)) The year after I decided to take *AP CS*. While I knew I wanted to work in tech somewhere, it was my year in this class that really cemented my desire to work in Computer Science itself.

During this year I learned Java, Recursion, OOP, Unity, and C#. Towards the end of the year I fell in love with optimization, something about optimizing for cache lines, multi-threading, and SIMD really got to me. So, the next year I took *Game & App Development* and enrolled to Bellevue College through the Running Start program. This year I would pivot more towards C++ and physics simulations.
